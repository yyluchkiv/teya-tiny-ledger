Task: $ARGUMENTS

1. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get today's date. Derive <slug> = 3-6 word kebab-case summary
   of the task. Filename = plans/<date>-<slug>.md.

2. Write the plan file plans/<date>-<slug>.md with these sections:

   # <Title>

   ## Goal
   One paragraph: what exists after this task that doesn't exist now.

   ## Assumptions
   Bullet list of anything inferred. Write "None." if fully specified.

   ## Stack / constraints
   Technology choices locked for this plan. Write "To be decided." if not specified.

   ## Affected files
   Every file to be created or modified, tree-style paths.

   ## Ordered steps
   Numbered list. Each step = one coherent unit of work.

   ## Risks
   Minimum 2 bullets. Format: one sentence problem + one sentence mitigation.

   ## Verification
   Exact shell commands: build, test, smoke test.
   Last line: "Done when: <one sentence success criterion>."

3. Print one line: `Plan written: plans/<filename>.md`
   Nothing else.

DO NOT run any git commands.
DO NOT create any branches.
DO NOT open any PRs.
DO NOT do anything after writing the file.
STOP after step 3.
